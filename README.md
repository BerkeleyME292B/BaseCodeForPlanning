### ME292B Individual Project: Planning
This is the base repository for starting an individual project. Please fork this repository and begin your project. Note that the files in **./commonroad-search-master/tutorials** and **./commonroad-search-master/scenarios** should be downloaded from the [Search-based Motion Planner with Motion Primitives](https://link-url-here.orghttps://gitlab.lrz.de/tum-cps/commonroad-search). The output solution files should be stored in the folder **./solutions**. Ensure that your individual repository is private to prevent others from viewing your code and commits. Be aware that the teaching assistants (TAs) can access all commits and your code. If you prefer your work to remain unseen by us, please inform us before beginning your project.
